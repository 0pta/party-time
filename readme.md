## Party Time!

A chance to practice with jQuery events.

### Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repository.
1. Read through the html, styles, and scripts.
1. Come up with at least one question or comment about the code.

### Task List

#### Basic DOM Manipulation
* Manually remove the alerts.
* Manually add three food items in the following style:
  ```html
  <li>Item name x<span>0</span></li>
  ```
* Manually add three songs to the playlist in the following style:
  ```html
  <li>Song Name by<span>Artist</span></li>
  ```

#### Food & Drinks

* Add a button to hide and show the food and drink list.
* Add a form to add new food or drink.
* On submit, add the food or drink to the list.
* The first time you submit, remove the alert.
* On submit, clear the form.
* Before submit, validate that there's something in the input.

#### Playlist

* Add a button to hide and show the playlist.
* Add a form to add a new song.
* On submit, add the song to the playlist.
* The first time you submit, remove the alert.
* On submit, clear the form.
* Before submit, validate that there's something in the input.

#### Guests

* Add a button to hide and show the dance floor and current guests.
* Add a form to add a new guest.
* On submit, add the song to the current guest list.
* The first time you submit, remove the alert.
* On submit, clear the form.
* Before submit, validate that there's something in the input.
* When you click on a guest and then on a square, that guest moves to that square.
* When you double click on a guest in the square, they return to the guest list.

#### Stretch

* Add additional inputs for all the various lists. For example, a "healthy" checkbox for food and drink, a song genre, and guest first and last names.
* When you click on a food and then on a guest, remove one from the item's quantity. If the quantity reaches 0, remove the item completely.
* Add a track time to each song. When you click on a song, set a timer so that it counts down from that time. When the time is up, remove the item.
